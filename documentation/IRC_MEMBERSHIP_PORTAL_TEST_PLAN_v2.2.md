## Appendix A: Test Data Cleanup

After testing, clean up test accounts:

```sql
DELETE FROM members WHERE call_sign LIKE 'TEST%';
DELETE FROM members WHERE call_sign = 'NEWADD1';
DELETE FROM members WHERE call_sign = 'TEST3NEW';
DELETE FROM members WHERE call_sign = 'TEST1NEW';
```

## Appendix B: Known Limitations

* Session timeout is 24 hours (cannot be changed without code modification)
* PDF export limited to ~1000 members (performance degrades beyond that)
* Email delivery depends on SMTP provider reliability
* Backup retention is 30 days (configurable in script)

## Appendix C: Browser Compatibility

Test in these browsers:
- ☐ Chrome (latest)
- ☐ Firefox (latest)
- ☐ Safari (latest)
- ☐ Edge (latest)
- ☐ Mobile Safari (iOS)
- ☐ Mobile Chrome (Android)
