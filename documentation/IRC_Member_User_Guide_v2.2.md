## 6. Understanding Your Membership Status

### 6.1 Membership Types

**FULL** - Regular voting member with full privileges

**ASSOCIATE** - Non-voting member

**LIFE** - Lifetime member with no annual dues

**HONORARY** - Honorary membership

### 6.2 Paid Through Year

This field shows the last year your dues are paid through. For example:

* **Paid Through: 2027** means your membership is active - good through December 31, 2027
* **Paid Through: 2026** means your membership is current but you'll need to renew for 2027
* **Paid Through: 2025** means your membership has expired

**How to read your status:**

If it's currently 2026:
* Paid through 2027 or later = **Active** (green) - You're all set!
* Paid through 2026 = **Expiring** (yellow) - Time to think about renewing
* Paid through 2025 or earlier = **Expired** (red) - Please renew

When you pay your annual dues, an administrator will update this field.

### 6.3 Renewing Your Membership

To renew your membership:

1. Contact IRC about renewal and payment options
2. Submit your dues payment
3. An administrator will update your 'Paid Through' year
4. You may receive an email notification when your record is updated

---

## 7. Expiration Notifications (NEW)

The IRC Membership Portal now automatically monitors your membership status and sends email notifications when your status changes.

### 7.1 What Notifications You'll Receive

You will receive emails in these situations:

**When your membership changes to "expiring soon":**
* Happens when you're paid through the current year only
* Subject: "IRC Membership Expiring Soon"
* Message reminds you to renew to continue your membership into next year
* Example: In 2026, if you're paid through 2026, you'll see "expiring" status

**When your membership expires:**
* Happens on January 1st if you didn't renew
* Subject: "IRC Membership Expired"
* Message informs you that your membership has expired and how to renew

**When you renew your membership:**
* Happens when administrator updates your paid through year
* Subject: "IRC Membership Active"
* Message confirms your membership is active and thanks you for renewing

### 7.2 How Often Will I Receive Notifications?

You will only receive a notification when your status actually changes. For example:

* Your membership stays "active" (paid 2027) all year → No notifications
* January 1: Your membership changes "expiring" (2025) to "expired" → One notification
* You renew: Admin updates to 2027, changes "expired" to "active" → One thank you email
* Your status stays "expiring" (paid 2026) all year → No additional notifications

You will NOT receive repeated emails about the same status. The system is designed to inform you of changes, not spam you.

### 7.3 What If I Don't Receive Notifications?

If you believe your status changed but didn't receive a notification:

* Check your spam/junk folder
* Verify your email address is correct in your profile
* Contact an IRC administrator if your email needs to be updated

### 7.4 Keeping Your Email Current

To ensure you receive important notifications:

* Keep your email address up to date in your profile
* Add the IRC sender address to your contacts to prevent spam filtering
* Check your email regularly

## 8. Logging Out

When you're finished using the portal, it's a good practice to log out, especially if you're using a shared or public computer.

**To log out:**

1. Click the 'Logout' link in the top right corner of any page
2. You will be returned to the login page

Your session will automatically expire after 24 hours of inactivity for security purposes.

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I upgraded my license and have a new call sign. How do I update it?**

A: Only administrators can change call signs. Contact an IRC administrator at service-desk.ircinc.org and provide your old and new call signs. Once updated, you'll need to login with your new call sign.

---

**Q: Can I change my membership type?**

A: Membership types are set by IRC administrators based on your membership status. Contact IRC if you believe your membership type needs to be changed.

---

**Q: I moved. How do I update my address?**

A: Simply log in to the portal, update your address fields, and click 'Save Changes'. Your new address will be immediately updated.

---

**Q: I never received a welcome email with my login information.**

A: When your account is created, you should receive a password reset email. Check your spam/junk folder first. If you still don't see it, contact an IRC administrator at service-desk.ircinc.org. They can resend the password reset link.

---

**Q: Can I have multiple email addresses on file?**

A: The system stores one email address per member. If you need to change your email, simply update the email field on your profile.

---

**Q: Why can't I login?**

A: Common reasons:
* Make sure your call sign is in UPPERCASE
* Verify you're using the correct password
* If you recently changed your call sign, use the new one
* Try the Password Recovery feature
* Contact an administrator if problems persist

---

**Q: Is my information secure?**

A: Yes. The portal uses industry-standard security measures including encrypted passwords, secure connections, and restricted access. Only IRC administrators can view the complete member database.

---

**Q: Will I be notified before my membership expires?**

A: Yes! If you're paid through the current year only (e.g., paid through 2026 when it's 2026), your status shows as "Expiring Soon" year-round. You'll receive an email notification on January 1st if your membership expires (changes from "expiring" to "expired"). This gives you the entire year to renew.

---

**Q: I didn't receive an expiration notification. Is something wrong?**

A: Check your spam folder first. If you still don't see it, verify your email address is correct in your profile. If your status hasn't actually changed, you won't receive a notification (this prevents spam). Contact an administrator if you need assistance.
