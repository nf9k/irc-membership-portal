IRC Membership Expiration Notification Script

Checks member expiration status and sends notifications when status changes.
Runs via cron - only sends emails when status actually changes.

Status Definitions:
- ACTIVE: Paid through a future year (2027+)
- EXPIRING: Paid through current year (2026)
- EXPIRED: Paid through a past year (2025 or earlier)

Notifications are sent when status changes, not on a schedule.
This prevents spam while keeping members informed.
